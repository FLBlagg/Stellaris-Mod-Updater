# Stellaris-Mod-Updater
A simple python and batch file that runs a script to rename the "path=steam/common/..." string to "path=mod/..." for correct mod syntax

# Tutorial

# Installation
- Install Python from their website (https://www.python.org/downloads/) or from Windows Store

# Modify The Path
- Replace 'C:/Users/...' in the script with the actual path to your mod folder.
- (OPTIONAL/ONLY IF USING BAT FILE) Replace 'C:/Users/...' in the bat file with the path to the python script

# Place the File
- Navigate to your Stellaris mod folder (Documents/Paradox Interactive/Stellaris/Mod) and drop the .py file directly into the folder.
  
# Run The File
- Open Command Prompt (Windows) or Terminal (macOS/Linux).
- Navigate to the directory where you saved your .py script. You can use the 'cd' command to change directories.
